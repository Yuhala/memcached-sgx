## Zero-config (ZC) switchless
- This is a research project aimed to remove the need for configuring Intel SGX switchless calls at build time.
- Doing this obviates the performance degradation due to bad configurations.
- This repo follows our publication at the IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), 2023

## System architecture
![ZC switchless architecture](./imgs/architecture.pdf)
- The [in-application scheduler](./sgx/App/zcUntrusted/scheduler.cpp) periodically obtains application metrics such as number of fallback calls to determine the most appropriate number of worker threads to use for switchless calls.
- The number of worker threads is chosen in such a way as to minimize waste of CPU resources while providing good performance relative to a non-switchless system.
